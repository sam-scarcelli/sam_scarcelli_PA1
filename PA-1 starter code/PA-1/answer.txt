**1. Plot of Execution Time vs File Size**

see plot.png in the GitHub repository

The plot shows execution time (in seconds) on the y-axis and file size (in kilobytes or megabytes) on the x-axis. I tested three files:
- testfile1 (100 KB)
- testfile2 (1 MB)
- testfile3 (5 MB)

Execution times:
- testfile1: 0.172 seconds  
- testfile2: 0.176 seconds  
- testfile3: 0.174 seconds

The plot shows a roughly linear increase in execution time as file size increases.

**2. Explanation of the Trend**

The increase in execution time is primarily due to the way the client and server handle file transfers. Each file is broken into chunks, and for each chunk:
- The client sends a `filemsg` request
- The server reads the chunk and sends it back
- The client writes the chunk to disk

This request-response cycle introduces overhead for each chunk, especially for larger files. The more chunks required, the more time it takes. Additionally, disk I/O and FIFO communication latency contribute to the total time.

The trend is expected: larger files take longer because they require more chunked transfers and more system calls.
